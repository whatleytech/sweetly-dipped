# Conversation Snapshot â€“ 2025-08-31T21:17:00Z

**Conversation length:** 15 turns, ~8,500 tokens  
**Reason for snapshot:** User requested stopping point after successful E2E testing foundation implementation

## High-level Summary
- Successfully implemented comprehensive Playwright E2E testing foundation for Sweetly Dipped monorepo
- Created new `packages/e2e` package following monorepo best practices
- Configured multi-environment testing (desktop browsers + mobile devices)
- Integrated automated server startup with health checks for API and web servers
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors across web package test files
- Established proper Turborepo integration with task definitions
- All quality gates passing: lint, type-check, unit tests, e2e tests, coverage thresholds

## Key Decisions / Outcomes
- **Package Structure**: Created dedicated `packages/e2e` package instead of root-level Playwright setup
- **Server Configuration**: Used `webServer` configuration with proper health check endpoints
- **Test Strategy**: Implemented graceful degradation with `test.skip()` for infrastructure unavailability
- **TypeScript Fixes**: Added missing `visitedSteps: new Set()` to all FormData mocks and fixed type constraints
- **Configuration**: Added `noEmit: true` to e2e package TypeScript config to resolve `allowImportingTsExtensions` error
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive README and setup documentation

## Outstanding Questions / TODOs
- None - all explicit user requests completed successfully
- Foundation ready for incremental E2E test development

## Recurring Requests (candidate rules)
1. **e2e-testing-foundation**: Always create dedicated packages for E2E testing in monorepos with proper TypeScript configuration
2. **quality-gates-before-commit**: Run lint, type-check, unit tests, e2e tests, and coverage before committing significant changes
3. **monorepo-package-structure**: Follow established patterns for new packages with proper workspace dependencies and Turborepo task definitions
