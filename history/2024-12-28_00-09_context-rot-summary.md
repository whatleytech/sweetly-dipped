# Conversation Snapshot – 2024-12-28T00:09:00

**Conversation length:** ~40 turns, ~15,000+ tokens  
**Reason for snapshot:** Exceeded CONTEXT_TURNS_THRESHOLD (30) and user reported increased response latency

## High-level Summary
- Successfully scaffolded a luxury chocolate e-commerce site with React + TypeScript + Vite
- Built responsive landing page with hero, treats grid, packages table, CTA, and footer
- Implemented multi-step "Design Your Package" form with local storage persistence
- Established robust testing with Vitest + React Testing Library (80%+ coverage)
- Applied strict commit policy with lint/type-check/test gates
- Created comprehensive brand color system with CSS variables and TypeScript mapping

## Key Decisions / Outcomes
- **Tech Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Yarn, Vitest, React Router, CSS Modules
- **Node Version**: v22.17.1 LTS (enforced via .nvmrc)
- **Architecture**: Feature-based folder structure, component isolation, shared theme system
- **Brand Colors**: Defined 6-color palette (browns, pinks, cream, white) with accessibility compliance
- **Form System**: 8-step conditional flow with validation, phone masking, localStorage persistence
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit hooks for lint/test/coverage (≥80%) + formatted commit messages
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for all components, integration tests for pages, mocked dependencies

## Outstanding Questions / TODOs
- Form submission endpoint/backend integration
- Additional form field implementations (pickup calendar could be enhanced)
- Image assets (currently using placeholders)
- About page implementation
- Production deployment configuration
- SEO optimization and meta tags

## Recurring Requests (candidate rules)
1. **form-validation-patterns**: Standardize email/phone validation with consistent regex patterns and user feedback
2. **test-coverage-enforcement**: Mandate unit tests for all new components with specific coverage thresholds per file type
3. **commit-granularity**: Enforce logical commit grouping (features vs chores vs fixes) with standardized prefixes
