# Conversation Snapshot â€“ 2025-08-24T01:27:00Z

**Conversation length:** 30+ turns, 15,000+ tokens  
**Reason for snapshot:** User requested stopping point after successful test fixes and commit

## High-level Summary
- Successfully migrated from localStorage to backend API with Express.js
- Fixed all 12 failing tests that were introduced during API migration
- Achieved 100% test pass rate (349 tests passing)
- Maintained 86.93% code coverage (above 80% threshold)
- Completed API refactoring into modular controllers
- Made successful commit following commit standards

## Key Decisions / Outcomes
- **API Architecture**: Chose Express.js with in-memory storage over localStorage
- **State Management**: Implemented React Query for data fetching and caching
- **Test Strategy**: Adapted tests to work with controlled components and async API calls
- **Mock Strategy**: Updated mocks to return updated data instead of static responses
- **Error Handling**: Implemented proper error states and loading states
- **Code Organization**: Split monolithic API into separate controllers (form-data, health, order)

## Outstanding Questions / TODOs
- All immediate TODOs completed
- No outstanding issues remaining
- Codebase is production-ready for next development phase

## Recurring Requests (candidate rules)
1. **test-fix-pattern**: Always fix failing tests before committing, following the pattern of updating mocks to return dynamic data and using rerender for controlled component testing
2. **api-migration-testing**: When migrating from localStorage to API, update test mocks to simulate real API behavior and handle async state updates properly
3. **commit-quality-gates**: Always run lint, type-check, and tests before committing, ensuring all quality gates pass
