# Conversation Snapshot â€“ 2025-08-17T16:29:00Z

**Conversation length:** 30+ turns, 15,000+ tokens  
**Reason for snapshot:** User requested context reset

## High-level Summary
- Successfully implemented background video for HeroSection component with optimization
- Converted video from MOV to optimized MP4 format (960x540, 20fps, no audio, 1.2MB)
- Fixed multiple failing tests across LandingPage, ReferralSource, and TermsAndConditions components
- Achieved 93.79% test coverage with all 234 tests passing
- Followed project commit process rules and quality gates

## Key Decisions / Outcomes
- **Video Optimization**: Used FFmpeg with H.264 codec, CRF 32, and slow preset for optimal web performance
- **Component Architecture**: Maintained HeroSection as a Link-based navigation rather than button-based CTA
- **Test Strategy**: Updated tests to match actual component text and behavior rather than assumptions
- **Quality Standards**: All commits followed conventional commit format with proper scoping and descriptive messages

## Outstanding Questions / TODOs
- None - all requested features completed and tested
- Video background implementation fully functional and optimized
- Test suite fully green with comprehensive coverage

## Recurring Requests (candidate rules)
1. **Video optimization workflow**: User frequently requests video format conversion and optimization for web use
2. **Test maintenance**: Regular need to update tests when component text or behavior changes
3. **Commit process adherence**: Consistent application of commit message format and quality gates
