# Conversation Snapshot â€“ 2025-08-23T22:55:00Z

**Conversation length:** 25+ turns, ~12,000 tokens  
**Reason for snapshot:** User indicated good stopping point after completing Thank You page feature

## High-level Summary
- Successfully implemented a complete "Thank You" page for the Sweetly Dipped order confirmation flow
- Created comprehensive test coverage with deterministic date mocking
- Fixed multiple critical bugs related to order number generation and incrementing
- Followed strict commit standards and quality gates throughout development
- Implemented proper localStorage persistence and navigation flow

## Key Decisions / Outcomes

### Thank You Page Implementation
- **Order Number Generation**: Implemented date-sequential format (YYYY-MM-DD-XXX)
- **Package Summary**: Created utility functions to generate readable summaries
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured content fits without scrolling on all device sizes
- **Navigation Flow**: Integrated with existing form flow from ConfirmationPage

### Bug Fixes & Improvements
1. **Date Mocking Fix**: Resolved flaky tests by implementing proper `vi.useFakeTimers()` and `vi.setSystemTime()`
2. **Double Incrementing Fix**: Prevented order numbers from incrementing twice in React StrictMode using `useRef`
3. **Page Refresh Fix**: Moved order number generation to ConfirmationPage to prevent incrementing on refresh

### Technical Architecture
- **Utility Functions**: Created `orderUtils.ts` and `packageSummaryUtils.ts` for business logic
- **Test Coverage**: Achieved 100% coverage on new components with comprehensive test suites
- **Date Handling**: Fixed timezone issues by parsing dates as local time
- **localStorage Management**: Proper persistence and cleanup of order data

### Code Quality
- **Commit Standards**: Followed strict commit message format and size limits
- **Quality Gates**: All commits passed linting, type checking, and test requirements
- **Component Structure**: Maintained single-responsibility principle and proper separation of concerns

## Outstanding Questions / TODOs
- None - all requested features completed and tested
- Ready for production deployment

## Recurring Requests (candidate rules)
1. **date-mocking-pattern**: Always use `vi.useFakeTimers()` and `vi.setSystemTime()` for deterministic date testing, avoid relying on actual current date in tests
2. **order-number-persistence**: Order numbers should be generated once at submission time and persisted in localStorage, not regenerated on page views
3. **localStorage-structure**: When storing complex data in localStorage, use consistent object structure with clear property names and include all necessary data
