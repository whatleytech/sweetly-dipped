# Conversation Snapshot â€“ 2025-08-17T19:58:00Z

**Conversation length:** 30+ turns, 15,000+ tokens  
**Reason for snapshot:** User requested stopping point after successful FormSidebar refactoring

## High-level Summary
- Successfully refactored the FormSidebar component from a monolithic 264-line component into a modular, maintainable architecture
- Extracted business logic into reusable utility functions with comprehensive test coverage
- Created component-specific CSS modules for better organization and maintainability
- Implemented proper commit process following project rules with 5 focused commits
- Achieved 93.55% test coverage with all 310 tests passing

## Key Decisions / Outcomes
- **Utility Extraction**: Created `formStepUtils.ts` and `formSummaryUtils.ts` to separate business logic from UI components
- **Component Modularization**: Split FormSidebar into `StepItem.tsx` and `ProgressSection.tsx` for better single responsibility
- **CSS Organization**: Created component-specific CSS modules (`StepItem.module.css`, `ProgressSection.module.css`) instead of one large file
- **Commit Strategy**: Split large refactoring into 5 focused commits following conventional commit standards
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained 100% coverage for all new utilities and components while preserving existing functionality

## Outstanding Questions / TODOs
- None - all refactoring goals completed successfully
- All quality gates passed (lint, type-check, tests, coverage)
- All commits follow project commit process rules

## Recurring Requests (candidate rules)
1. **component-modularization**: Extract complex components into smaller, focused components with single responsibilities
2. **utility-extraction**: Move business logic from components into reusable utility functions in `src/utils/`
3. **css-modularization**: Create component-specific CSS modules instead of large shared stylesheets
4. **commit-granularity**: Split large changes into focused commits following conventional commit format
5. **test-coverage-maintenance**: Ensure all new code has comprehensive test coverage before committing
