# Conversation Snapshot â€“ 2024-12-28T19:15:00

**Conversation length:** ~35+ turns, ~18,000+ tokens  
**Reason for snapshot:** Exceeded CONTEXT_TURNS_THRESHOLD (30) and TOKEN_THRESHOLD (15,000)

## High-level Summary
- Enhanced multi-step form with unselect functionality for "By the Dozen" component
- Implemented smooth scrolling navigation with step headers positioned at top of screen
- Refactored form architecture: extracted shared components (FormButtons, FormStepContainer)
- Centralized types and constants (formTypes.ts, formData.ts, timeUtils.ts)
- Enhanced Pickup Details with 15-minute interval time grid, date validation, and rush order logic
- Resolved extensive mobile responsiveness issues across multiple device breakpoints
- Fixed form sidebar progress calculation bug when "by-dozen" step is skipped
- Maintained comprehensive test coverage with iterative test improvements

## Key Decisions / Outcomes
- **Form UX**: Unselect radio buttons by clicking selected option (onClick + onChange handlers)
- **Navigation**: Smooth scroll to step header with 80px offset for optimal visibility
- **Architecture**: Extracted reusable FormButtons and FormStepContainer components
- **Data Structure**: Refactored time slots to use structured objects with hour/minute/timeOfDay
- **Validation**: Implemented past date prevention, unavailable periods, and rush order detection
- **Mobile Design**: Comprehensive responsive breakpoints (767px, 420px, 380px) with overflow prevention
- **State Management**: Updated FormData interface with new properties (pickupTimeWindow, rushOrder)
- **Testing**: Dynamic date helpers for reliable test execution across time periods

## Outstanding Questions / TODOs
- Fix localStorage persistence - form data gets cleared on page refresh
- Form submission endpoint/backend integration
- Additional form field implementations
- Image assets optimization
- About page implementation
- Production deployment configuration
- SEO optimization and meta tags

## Recurring Requests (candidate rules)
1. **mobile-responsive-testing**: Mandate testing on multiple device breakpoints with specific CSS overflow prevention patterns
2. **form-state-migration**: Implement data migration strategies when FormData interface changes
3. **iterative-problem-solving**: Document and test edge cases discovered through user feedback (radio button behavior, date validation, etc.)
