# Conversation Snapshot â€“ 2025-08-29T23:06:00Z

**Conversation length:** 30+ turns, 15,000+ tokens  
**Reason for snapshot:** Manual trigger of context-rot-detector

## High-level Summary
- Successfully migrated a Vite + React + Express monorepo to Turborepo with Yarn 4 workspaces
- Restructured project into packages: web, api, shared-types, config-eslint, config-ts
- Implemented comprehensive testing with 85.7% global coverage and HTML reports
- Fixed all lint errors and established professional development workflow
- Created custom coverage aggregation scripts and global HTML reports

## Key Decisions / Outcomes
- **Monorepo Structure:** Adopted Turborepo with Yarn 4 workspaces for better package management
- **Shared Types:** Created @sweetly-dipped/shared-types package for FormData type sharing
- **Configuration:** Implemented shared ESLint and TypeScript configs across packages
- **Testing:** Maintained 85.7% test coverage with custom global coverage reporting
- **Linting:** Fixed all ESLint errors including test globals, React imports, and ESM compatibility
- **Coverage Reports:** Built custom HTML coverage reports with brand styling

## Outstanding Questions / TODOs
- Consider adding more comprehensive API tests beyond basic structure test
- Evaluate if additional shared packages are needed for utilities
- Monitor Turborepo cache performance in CI/CD environment

## Recurring Requests (candidate rules)
1. **monorepo-best-practices**: Always use Turborepo task pipelines and Yarn 4 workspaces for monorepo projects
2. **coverage-reporting**: Implement global coverage aggregation with HTML reports for multi-package projects
3. **eslint-configuration**: Use shared ESLint configs with proper test globals and React imports for monorepos
