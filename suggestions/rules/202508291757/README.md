# Cursor Rules Improvement Suggestions

**Generated:** 2025-01-27 17:57  
**Context:** Rules audit and improvement recommendations

## Overview

This directory contains actionable suggestions for improving the Cursor rules configuration based on a comprehensive audit of the existing rules. Each suggestion is designed to be picked up individually by an agent with sufficient context to implement the changes.

## Immediate Action Items

### 1. Fix Package Manager Conflict
**File:** `fix-package-manager-conflict.md`  
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** 30 minutes

Consolidate conflicting package manager rules (`package-preferences.mdc` and `package-manager.mdc`) into a single `dependency-management.mdc` file.

### 2. Remove Duplicate Content in Component Size Rule
**File:** `remove-duplicate-content-component-size.md`  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** 15 minutes

Clean up duplicated content in `component-size.mdc` and improve clarity of the 250 LOC limit.

### 3. Add TypeScript Configuration Rule
**File:** `add-typescript-configuration-rule.md`  
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** 45 minutes

Create a new `typescript-configuration.mdc` rule to enforce strict TypeScript settings, type safety, and project setup standards.

### 4. Create Accessibility Standards Rule
**File:** `create-accessibility-standards-rule.md`  
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** 60 minutes

Create a new `accessibility-standards.mdc` rule covering ARIA implementation, keyboard navigation, screen reader testing, and focus management.

### 5. Add Error Handling Patterns Rule
**File:** `add-error-handling-patterns-rule.md`  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** 45 minutes

Create a new `error-handling-patterns.mdc` rule standardizing error boundaries, user feedback, error logging, and recovery patterns.

## Implementation Order

1. **Start with high-priority items** (TypeScript and Accessibility)
2. **Fix conflicts first** (Package Manager)
3. **Clean up existing rules** (Component Size)
4. **Add missing patterns** (Error Handling)

## Expected Outcomes

After implementing all suggestions:
- **Eliminated rule conflicts** and duplication
- **Comprehensive TypeScript enforcement** with strict mode
- **Full accessibility compliance** with WCAG 2.1 AA
- **Standardized error handling** across the application
- **Cleaner, more maintainable rules** configuration
