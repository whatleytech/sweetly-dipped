# App.tsx Contains Unused Demo Code

**Severity:** 4  
**File:** `src/App.tsx`  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Problem

The `App.tsx` component contained boilerplate demo code instead of actual application logic:

```tsx
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <a href="https://vite.dev" target="_blank">
          <img src={viteLogo} className="logo" alt="Vite logo" />
        </a>
        <a href="https://react.dev" target="_blank">
          <img src={reactLogo} className="logo react" alt="React logo" />
        </a>
      </div>
      <h1>Vite + React</h1>
      <div className="card">
        <button onClick={() => setCount((count) => count + 1)}>
          count is {count}
        </button>
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to test HMR
        </p>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Why It Was Problematic

- Contained boilerplate demo code instead of actual application logic
- Created confusion about the application's entry point
- Unused imports and state that should be cleaned up
- Didn't follow the established routing pattern used in main.tsx

## Solution Implemented

**Removed the unused App component entirely** since the application uses React Router with routing handled directly in `main.tsx`. The `Layout` component wraps the `Routes` and provides the application structure.

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Removed `src/App.tsx` (unused demo component)
2. ✅ Removed `src/App.css` (unused demo styles)
3. ✅ Removed `src/App.test.tsx` (unused test file)

### Why This Solution Was Chosen:
- The application already has a proper routing setup in `main.tsx`
- The `Layout` component provides the application structure
- No need for an additional `App` component that just renders a router outlet
- Follows the principle of removing unused code

## Verification

- ✅ All tests pass (349 tests)
- ✅ ESLint passes with no issues
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Application functionality preserved
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing routing

The application now has a cleaner structure without unused demo code.
