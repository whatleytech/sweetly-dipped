- Before generating, running or testing code, read the **project-root `.nvmrc`** file and adopt that exact Node.js version (major and minor).
- Warn the user if the requested feature uses syntax or APIs that are not available in that Node release; suggest a polyfill or alternate implementation instead.
- If `.nvmrc` is missing, ask the user which Node version to target **before** writing code.
