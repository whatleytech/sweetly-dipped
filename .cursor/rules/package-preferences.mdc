- When a well-maintained, battle-tested package exists, prefer it over reinventing the wheel. Examples:
  • Lodash for collection utilities  
  • date-fns or dayjs for date manipulation  
  • Zod or Yup for runtime validation  
  • React Hook Form for forms  
  • TanStack Query for server state
- Evaluate lib health: ≥ 5k GitHub stars, recent commits (< 12 months), permissive license.
- Wrap third-party code behind a thin adapter when helpful to avoid vendor lock-in.
- Every new dependency must be added with `pnpm add pkg@latest` and properly typed (use `@types/*` if needed).
