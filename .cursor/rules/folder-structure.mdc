description: Enforce React + Vite folder structure
globs: ["**/*"]

Use the following top-level layout:

  src/
    assets/            # Static images, fonts
    components/        # Generic, reusable UI pieces
    features/          # Feature-centric folders (each may contain sub-components, hooks, slices, tests)
    pages/             # Route components (if using React Router)
    hooks/             # Shared custom hooks
    utils/             # Pure functions / helpers
    api/               # API clients & data fetching
    types/             # Shared type definitions
  public/              # Vite public assets
  __tests__/           # Cross-feature integration tests
  .cursor/rules/       # Cursor rule files

Rules:
- Do NOT place business logic in `components/`; put it in `features/` or `hooks/`.
- Index barrels (`index.ts`) are allowed only for re-export convenience; avoid deep barrels that hide dependencies.
- Keep imports absolute via a `tsconfig.json` path alias (e.g. `@/components/Button`).
