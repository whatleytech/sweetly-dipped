- A React component should:
  • Have ≤ 250 LOC (including types and styles).  
  • Receive **typed props** and export those props for reuse (`export type { FooProps }`).  
  • Contain no more than one `useEffect` (split into custom hooks when logic grows).  
  • Extract reusable logic into `src/hooks/` and pure helpers into `src/utils/`.
- A function should do ONE thing; if it’s > 40 LOC or has nested conditionals, break it up.
- Prefer composition over prop drilling; use context sparingly and only for cross-cutting concerns (theme, auth, cart).
