# ────────────  METADATA  ────────────
name: Review existing Cursor rules
description: >
  When invoked, the agent must audit every project-scoped rule
  (.cursor/rules/**) and all active User Rules.  
  It should produce an organised report that:
    1. Lists any rules that overlap or can be consolidated.
    2. Points out vague language or missing details that reduce rule efficacy.
    3. Flags rules that appear obsolete, redundant, or low-value.
    4. Recommends brand-new rules that would improve pairing with the agent
       (e.g. testing strategy, TypeScript conventions, monorepo structure,
       shared ESLint config, etc.).

# HOW TO USE

Type `@review existing rules` or open the rule via the context
picker.  
The agent must then perform the following **six steps**:

1. **Inventory**  
   • Gather every rule in `.cursor/rules/**` and all active User Rules.  
   • For each rule capture: file name, rule type, description (or first line).

2. **Consolidation analysis**  
   • Detect duplicated guidance or rules that share >50 % topical overlap.  
   • Propose merges, naming which files to combine and suggesting a single
     concise replacement title.

3. **Clarity & precision check**  
   • Mark any rule that is:
     – >500 lines or trying to cover multiple domains.  
     – Lacking concrete examples / “DO / DON’T” lists.  
   • Suggest specific edits (add example, split, re-phrase, etc.).

4. **De-duplication / removal**  
   • Identify rules that:
     – Are fully superseded by newer ones.  
     – Merely restate generic best-practices already enforced by tooling
       (e.g. ESLint).  
   • Output a short justification and “❌ REMOVE” recommendation.

5. **Gap analysis & new-rule ideas**  
   • Considering the tech stack (TypeScript, Vite, React, NestJS,
     monorepo, ESLint, test pyramid), list high-impact rules that do **not**
     exist yet, with a one-sentence benefit description each.

6. **Create suggestion files**  
   • Generate datetime using `date '+%Y%m%d%H%M'` command.  
   • Create directory structure: `suggestions/rules/<datetime>/`  
   • For each immediate action item, create a detailed suggestion file with:
     – Complete problem context and current state analysis  
     – Specific implementation steps with file paths and commands  
     – Expected outcomes and validation criteria  
     – Priority level and effort estimate  
     – **Branch checkout instruction** as first step: `git checkout -b rules/<file-name-without-extension>`  
   • Create a `README.md` index file with overview and implementation order  
   • Ensure each suggestion file has sufficient context for independent implementation

7. **Mark suggestions as completed**  
   • After implementing any suggestion, update the suggestion file with:
     – **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED at the top of the file
     – **Solution Implemented** section with details of what was done
     – **Benefits Achieved** section with validation results
     – Checkboxes (✅) for completed implementation steps
   • Update the README.md to reflect completion status
   • Commit the changes with appropriate commit message

# OUTPUT FORMAT

```
## Cursor Rule Audit — <timestamp>

### 1. Rules to Consolidate
- RuleA.mdc + RuleB.mdc → **Proposed-Combined-Name.mdc**  
  Rationale…

### 2. Rules Needing Clarity
| File | Issue | Suggested fix |
| ---- | ----- | ------------- |
| X.mdc | Vague wording | Replace… |

### 3. Rules to Remove
- ❌ **legacy-coding-style.mdc** — superseded by ESLint config

### 4. Suggested New Rules
1. **frontend-testing-strategy.mdc** — codifies RTL + Vitest pyramid
2. **monorepo-workspace-structure.mdc** — paths, package boundaries …

### 5. Suggestion Files Created
- `suggestions/rules/<datetime>/` directory with individual action files
- Each file contains complete context for independent implementation
- README.md with overview and implementation order

### 6. Completion Tracking
- Mark implemented suggestions with ✅ COMPLETED status
- Update files with implementation details and validation results
- Commit changes with descriptive commit messages
```

# GUIDELINES

- Keep the whole report under 300 lines.  
- Do **not** rewrite rules in full; provide actionable summaries.  
- Reference rule file names exactly so they are clickable in the UI.  
- Prefer bullet points; avoid prose padding.  
- Use respectful, constructive language.
